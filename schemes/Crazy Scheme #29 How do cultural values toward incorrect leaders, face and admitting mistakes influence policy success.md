#29 How do attitudes toward admitting mistakes, face affect policy success

So some polities have a culture of allowing public disagreement. Some prefer to hide public disagreement among the policy-makers that count.

Examples of polities that hide disagreement
- Brazil
- Lebanon
- China

Polities that display disagreement
- US
- New Zealand
- India
- Italy

Prediction:
Policies should be better where open disagreement is allowed. That is a very tough thing to measure. One way is to look at social outcomes relationship with social spending (is democracy good for the poor)

Code disagreement attitude in two ways. Do the policymakers themselves publish their disagreements? Do people beleive that leaders should "own up" to their mistakes?
