# Do term limits affect representative behavior in Auth parliaments

Figure out how term limits affect voting in democracies, do they align representatives with "what elites wanted all along" or with voters becasue only the aligned survive to the term limit? Besley's classic work is vague between the two. 

In theory, term limits should tell us about the selection pressures that representatives respond to. Are term limited reps suddenly more anti-leader? Or do only the most pro-leader representatives survive. Or is there a leader-voter axis that they move along? Lol, idk.
