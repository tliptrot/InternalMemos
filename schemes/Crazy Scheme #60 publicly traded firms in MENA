Why is there suc ha low rate of publically traded firms in the Middle East? Theory taht privately held or family firms are better clients to their patrongs. They can build a reputation over time for providing support in exchange for their protection. Publically traded firms would not have reputations to uphold bc changign owners. As a result they wouldn't receive the same protections. Must work on causal implications
