# Core question

Inspiration from Zvi Helman

"A politician can choose between two messages that affirm their loyalty: Advocating a beneficial policy, or advocating a useless and wasteful policy. They choose useless, because the motive behind advocating a beneficial policy is ambiguous. Maybe they wanted people to benefit!"

We can test this empirically.

First, take the effective policies identified by that education study. Then film or audio record a candidate advocating for the effective policies and the less effective policies. Afterward ask the respondents
- how much do you think the candidate cares about the affected group?
- how effective do you expect this policy to be?

See how perceived loyalty varies with effect, cost and cost-effectiveness.

Hypothesis -> the most cost effective policies will have low perceived loyalty because they are the lowest cost.
