# Scheme to protect the overseas investment of assets

Core intuition from Paler, 2013 in APSR - Windfalls could reduce monitoring by either reducing citizens loss aversion and therefore motivation to hold leaders accountable, or by reducing their knowledge of government revenue. "Once in possession of better information on government spending, the windfall group was just as intolerant of misuse".

"the effect of information was as great, if not greater, in the windfall treatment".

The scheme:

We provide an unusual form of political risk insurance. If the state exprorpiates your assets, we pay for an information campaign to the citizens fo the coutnry in question. The information concerns the exact amount of the windfall, the ratio to the total budget, and any information about how it's being used. We won't lie but will frame things to suggest a misuse of public funds. And we cite ourselves as the people who got robbed. Just owning that is more trustworthy.

Implementation notes
- Only offer in countries where the state does not control media (like China with Wii-chat)
- Find some political risk insurance people around DC and pitch the idea informally
- If they ban youtube we subsidize VPNs for n years for d dollars
