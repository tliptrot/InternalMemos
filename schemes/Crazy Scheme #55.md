Dollar and Svensson (2000) use the World Bankâ€™s self-assessment of the outcomes
of structural adjustment programs to see which characteristics distinguish the successful
instances of reform. About a third of the programs in their data set were assessed as failing to meet their objectives; this proportion rises to a half in Africa. This glass might be
seen as half-full or half-empty, but the historical analysis of the African case by van de
Walle (2001) is more clearly negative. The relatively weak outcomes in Africa could be
explained by another finding from the Dollar and Svensson study: conditionality was
likely to fail in particular contexts, especially when reforms were demanded of an
undemocratic regime that had been in power a long time.

Maybe some interesting authoritarian institutions story here?
