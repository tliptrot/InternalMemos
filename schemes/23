## How do people find out about their loved ones passing away?

In general, the police would prefer not to do their many unpleasant taks. All governments must overcome principal agents to force them to do so.

To solve this problem the state must compel them ot work

One particularly unpleasant track is identifying corpses and informing families about their passing. We survey people and aks how they learned of their most recent loved ones passing. We correct for hospitalization to measure police effectiveness.
