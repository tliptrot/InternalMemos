Inspired by Ethan's paper about CIA leaks, I'm curious if normal coups are surprises.

So look at times when regime change was truly unexpected. That would include accidental deaths of leaders and stuff. Run an event study, look at volatility.

Then run a similar model on coups. If no such effects, maybe the investors knew about the coup beforehand?
