# How do policy entrepreneurs in autocracies differ in their advocacy strategies?

Survey lots of PE's in different countries. Ideally, work in an international conference of policy entrepreneurs.

Ask about
- The types of appeals that they use
- Do they appeal to "security"
- How often do they advocate to people outside the government?
- Which actors do they most want to convince to adopt their issue frame?
- Do they attempt to alter the dominant issue frames?
