# Why would autocrats provide more services than a stationary bandit?

Start with Mancur Olson's stationary bandit. The bandit provides public goods such taht they maximize his own tax take, which is below the socially optimal amount.

Now suppose the autocrat wishes to incentivize obedience from some citizens. Suppose there occurs a temporary period of crisis in which citizens and the dictator both perceive that the dictator is vulnerable. During this period the citizen either defects or does not defect. The dictator survives with some probability p.

After the period of vulnerability the dictator can change the degree of service provision to punish the citizen.

However, I observe that for economically productive services the promise is not credible. A dictator providing only the roving bandit level of provision will not punish because doing so would hurt his payoff. A dictator who is over-providing will punish by reducing provision to the roving bandit level. 

This must have been written before, surely.
