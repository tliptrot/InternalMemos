# Why do some revolutions sustain ther ability to mobilize activists and shut down commerce and government longer

Theory - the key to maintaining the solidarity is coordinating to disperse the costs through the revolutionary coalition.

Wealthier societies are more able to coordinate than poorer societies and have more diverse income generating mechanisms.

Therefore they can better disperse the costs and make revenue without supporting the state to continue the ressistance.

Alternative explanation is ideological dedication to post-materialist values in rich societies.

Use OLS, should be the only available mechanism?
