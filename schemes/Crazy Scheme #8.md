# Correlates of State Capacity Project

### Idea

First I construct a bunch of measures of state capacity similary to #7 the weather stations project. Infant mortality. A survey component about access to services woudl be great but that probably doesn't exist. There are other measures in Desha's book's robustness checks

### Inspiration

The way psychologists/neuroscientists talk about intelligence tests and g-factor. So there are like 8 ways to assess inteligence which all represent a distinct cognitive task. Each task is sufficiently distinct that you can imagine them using completely different brain modules. But it turns out that all forms of intelligence are corellated, There's an underlying g-factor which connects them all.

Firstly, this has important descriptive content for predictions and for other people's studies of causal factors. Secondly, it is moderate evidence about the underlying mechanisms because some models of the origin of intelligence are consistent with g-factor and some are not. So the model where intelligence comes from the brain inheriting fewer genetic defects is consistent. The model where intellignece is a result of learned behaviors or motivation is less consistent. So correlating state capacity would have a similar value.
