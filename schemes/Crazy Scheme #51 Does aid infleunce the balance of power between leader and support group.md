# Theory

So we want to know if leaders can take advantage of windfalls to increase their personalism. This has already been done with the oil discovery paper. Therefore aid is the next windfall to investigate.

There are two problems to be overcome
1. Having a CIA solution
2. Having a detailed enough metric that the CIA solution works

We can solve problem 1 using the fuzzy regression discontinuity with the World Bank aid cutoff
We can solve problem 2 using the google Ngram method compiled by Junyan Jiang

Problem - we don't have the Ngram method by Junyan Jiang. We must email them for access to the data, offering coauthorship as an incentive.
