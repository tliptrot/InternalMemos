# The basic idea

>  There is currently no exhaustive list of military defections as many of them are unobservable. This makes any large-N analysis of defections difficult. However, the threat of military defections has implications for the leader’s decision to repress. I assume leaders want to avoid military defections whenever possible. When the probability of military defection is high, the leader’s optimal strategy is to use less repression, rather than risk defection. Conversely, if the probability of defection is low, then leaders can use repression strategically. Therefore, instead of deriving hypotheses about when a defection will occur, I will use this logic to derive hypotheses about the realized repression level within a country.

If I can find random variation in defection ability, I can demonstrate this.

One way to check is to look at the portion of military members from each ethnic group involved in repression. Then look at the portion of defectors who escape from each ethnic group. Look for an association. This has an endogeneity problem, but is a good first crack.

What is another instrument for ability to defect???

Or a regression discontinuity on the ability to defect?
