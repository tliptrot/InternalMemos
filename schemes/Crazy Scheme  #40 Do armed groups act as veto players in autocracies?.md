# Do armed groups act as veto players in autocracies

Code the number of nationwide armed groups with a distinct recruitment base. So in Jordan if the mukhabarrat and the army are recruited from the same pool, that's one. In Egypt if the mukhabarat is recruited from urban regime insiders and the army from southern rural people, that's two.

In Libya, count the militias?
In Lebanon, there are ~7 parties with armies I think.
In China there is one I think.
In Sudan there were 4/5 in 2019. The RSF, the army and two rebel armies

Then repeat Tsebelis's veto players analysis using the number of armed groups.
