# How do dictatorshisp manage different types of agencies and how does personalism affect their techniques?

Starting with Wilson's model of agency types.

outcomes observed  | YES             |   NO

Outputs obs.  Yes  | Production     |   Procedural

OP             NO   | Craft          |   Coping
              
Wilson argues that agencies vary in how observable their outputs and outcomes are. This variation changes the tools political principals can use to discipline their agents. so in a production agency discipline is easy because reporting. In coping its very hard.

So principals develop special institutions, like the Royal Afgricultural Council to oversee coping agencies on their behalfs.

Do autocracies form such institutions? How do they recruit for them? How does that recruitment change under autocracy?

What about personalism?

Design - maybe gather data on the different ways agencies are disciplined in Saudi Arabia. Then do a regression discontinuity on the disciplining techniques over the personalization episodes in 2018.

Alternative design
- look at RD in the number of leaks
