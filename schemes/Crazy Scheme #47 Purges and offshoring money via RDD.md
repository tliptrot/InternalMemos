# Use RDD to understand the relationship between purges and elites offshoring their wealth

Inspired by Jeremy Wallace meeting on 9/20/21

How do elites respond to the possibility of being removed from office or expropriated? One response is to move money out of the country to protect it. They may want to sequester the money in private accounts.

Plan - find an economist to pair up with. They know the data well, I know the politics well.

# Alternative version - use the World Bank's money to poor countries for fuzzy regression discontinuty design. More money -> greater elite infighting -> more offshoring of wealth
