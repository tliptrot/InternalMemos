# Coup prediction model but for major growth events

### The idea

So I make a predictive model for major growth events in the style of coup-cast. I use the same method for identifying growth accelerations as Pritchett uses in this one https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jdevepers.2.1-2.0003 . Then I create a model similar to the coup-cast model found here - https://oefresearch.org/activities/coup-cast .

### Why it might work

1. Prittchett identiefied a similar number of GA's as there have been coups
2. Neural networks are cool

### Why it might be valuable

1. Maybe we target policies toward the most likely to experience a growth episode??? This depends deeply on interpretation of the model. That is worrysome for applications. Uncertain.
