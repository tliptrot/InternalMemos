# standard budget cycles set up, read drazens book

In Jordan municipalities tend to overspend on personelle and underspend on capital, decreasing the quality of public goods.

I expect that the effects of capital on votes is lagged over time as people absorb the public goods and the capital slowly depreciates. But the effect of personelle should be instantaneous.

So we might observe a budget cycle where towns buy more capital right after an election and spend more on personelle near elections.
