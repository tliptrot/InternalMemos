# RQ - What are the governance outcomes of different parliamentary designs

Let us propose a study. Fuck expense, just write it big.

So we want to understand different mechanisms for aggregating the outcome predictions of a group of predictors.

## One design

The participants enter and are randomly sorted based on partisan identification or into fake parties.

Then all participants view the start of an RCT, but not the results. They have to predict which intervention is the most cost effective for improving education for example. Make sure the RCT is such that there's a wide distribution of people's predicted most effective intervention.

### Treatment group 1 (T1)

The parties each vote internally for a their most preferred policy, then they elect a representative. The representatives then debate to form a coalition with 50% of the members or 66% or whatever number. That policy wins and the participants receive a cash benefit based on the relative quality of selected treatment.

Experimentally vary 
  - number and size of "parties"
  - Threshold needed for policy adoption
  - Policy area - concavity vs. convexity? (defined by https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html )
