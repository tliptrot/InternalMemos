# Formal models of bureaucrats in autocracies

So the bureacrat can reveal a problem or hide the problem. Some chance of being caught? Imitate models in Formal models of nondemocratic politics in ARPS

## Data?

Covid data from autocracies

## Possible predictions

Once actors fabricate a few, they fabricate more and more often. But covid cases eventually go down from partial herd immunity in the bumps system.

Therefore in the US we would expect the size of future bumps is inversely correlated with past bumps. However in Russia there should be hidden or underestimated early bumps. So the beta on past cases would be lower in Russia than in other countries.
