Basic idea is that when states punish other states they punish the leaders. "Our quarell is with serbia's leaders, not it's people". Often sanctions stop when leaders die or are removed.

The theory is that when it's easy to replace the leader, regimes should just replace the leader to resume international support.

therefore we should observe longer sanctioining spells when leaders are more personalist. Or potentially under the high loyalty norm systems. Good to check both.
