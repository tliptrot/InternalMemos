# Policy predictive capacity under different regime types

## Motivation

Indian politicians spend most oftheir time gladhanding and facilitating corruption. They spend like no time on public policymaking. That paper about politicians in India from CPP. 

Maybe authoritarian polities have this problem less?

## Core hypothesis

What determines the ability of policy-makers to predict the relative effectiveness of government policies?
Furthermore, what political systems lead to policy-makers with greater predictive ability?

So we would be having polikers guess the results of already conducted randomized control trials. 

Steps

# Figure out if this has been done?

Check Vivalt's coauthors
just devour all research around it

RQ's
- has the predictive ability of polikers been assessed in any context
- What have the results been
- Has it ever been done in developing countries?
- Indian democrats spend much of their time facilitating patronage. How common is this observation?
- Do PR systems change that distribution (question probably answered)
