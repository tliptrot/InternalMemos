# Congruence study

Inspiration - the left-right axis is so vague and constructed that using it to measure congruence is ridiculous. The purpose of this study is to assess congruence differently.

Ideas for assessing congruence

- Show the start of a multi-intervention RCT to lots of citizens, ask which intervention they expect to be most effective. Which intervention do they expect the politicians to like, by party.
- Show the same RCT to lots of politicians. Ask which intervention is effective. Which intervention would voters expect to work. Which intervention would most help the party win an election?

- Take a recent but unpublished nationwide survey. Show it to party officials (MP's, activists, the folks and Friedrich Ehbert Stiftung, etc.) Ask them to guess the answers to the questions. Even better, vary the amount of policy relevant information given to the citizens. Compare the guessing ability of politicians between voting systems.

- Pick some policy that varies between countries. The legality of smoking inside, or the AstraZeneca vaccine approval or lockdown stuff. Any of that. Compare the congruence of those policies across countries with different electoral systems.

- Show people party manifestos and ask them to rank the manifestos
