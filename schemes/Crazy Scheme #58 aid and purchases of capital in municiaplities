# Question

How do aid disbursements change the allocation of municipal budgets? Theory is that aid to buy capital for municipalities is offset by a reduction in capital expenditures. This keeps the wages-capital ration more constand than it would otherwise be.

Problem is how to construct the counterfactual. How do we know how municipalities would behave if they received no aid?

# Research design

Municipalities in Lebanon are divided between hesbollah and non-hezbollah municipalities. NH munis get more aid, maybe they receive more in-kind aid. So the HB dividing line could construct the counterfactual expenditures between recipients and non-recipients.

# Next steps

- Make contacts in Lebanon in municipal aid world
- confirm basic ideas
- head to Lebanon this summer 
- scout like crazy
