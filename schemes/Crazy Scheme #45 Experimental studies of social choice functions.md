# A scheme for testing predictions about social choice functions

Okay so we want to know which set of voting rules aggregate stuff the best.

Anyway -

Go to India, get a bunch of new RCT's fresh off the line
Have conferences of experts, 100 per study or whatever
they each get d dollars if the group guesses the most cost effective policy
d * ce_s/ce_b otherwise, where ce_s is the selected policy's cost effectiveness and ce_b is the best.
they can view the proposals for each policy and data collection, but not the results
they then vote via some SCF (RCV, plurality, whatever)
Experimentally vary the SCF's
Observe quality of belief aggregation

For a lark, do a study in which participants lose f dollars if they are not voting for the winning vote. Observe change in outcome quality.
