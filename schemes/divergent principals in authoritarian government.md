# Do bureaucrats in autocracies have more variation in their principals?

Motivating example: In Jordan the royal court is the ultimate principal. However, the court practices fire alarm oversight on most ministries: they get involved when someone successfully complains to them. The mechanisms for complaint arrival are diverse

MWI is responsible to people who riot when their water does not arrive
MoA is repsonsible to rural voting interests and tribes

They have different principals => more conflict between ministries
