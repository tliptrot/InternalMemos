# Do Aid Windfalls Cause Personalization in Autocracies: A Hierschliefer conflict model for autocratic bargaining

Inspiration is this article - https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/101841/1/mpra_paper_101841.pdf

Try to figure out how the institutions of autocracies respond to the shock.

My assumption follows a Hirschliefer model. Increased windfall increases the pot of money to be fought over. One response to a larger pot is to increase the "decisiveness" of elite conflict. So you would increase the amount of purges and leader control. You might also "coup proof" by splitting the army. Or buy anti-elite weapons?

Not sure how I see this going, requires much more investigation.
