# Who picks the lowest hanging fruit?

A regulation moves behavior from point po (preinstitutional outcome) to piont io (institutional outcome). Call S the strength of the movement. Suppose all regulations have some aggregate benefit for the principal for the achieved affect S, u_1(S). Suppose that the actors constraiend by regulation also pay some cost, u_2(S). Let us consdier the ratio u_1/u_2 as the efficiency ratio of the regulation, R. 

R will be high for very efficient regulations such as leaded gasoline. R will be low, even below one, for inneficient regulations.

Then I take the 5 most popular social utility functions for measuring costs and rank a representative set of regulations on that axis. Then I look at the rate of regulatory adoption. Do regulators adopt regulations in order of cost? Are weak institutions launching regulations with high R or low R?

Regulations I could include
- leaded gasoline
- Exchange rate controls
- dual exchange rates
- food price controls
- idk what else, will add as I go
- drug controls
- banning poisonous pesticides

Alternatively I could look at the the lowest hanging fruit interventions.
