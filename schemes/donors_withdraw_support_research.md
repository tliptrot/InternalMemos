### Study when international aid donors decide to withdraw support

Inspired by NORAD report.

1. Why do they do it?
2. What predicts withdrawal
3. Is it mostly small portfolios (prediction from Bueno De Mesquita because large donors want something from the country so they cannot withdraw)
4. How do the regimes respond?
