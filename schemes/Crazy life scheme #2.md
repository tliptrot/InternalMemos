# For-Ex collapse and interest group co-optation

## Intuition

Lebanon has a very expensive systm of payoffs to coopt the leaders of different partie s and unions and militias and interest groups. When foreign exchagne collapses the regime has less money to pay off these factions. But the inflation of the currency and the increase in unemployment mean the alternatives to bribes are also scarcer. So does being coopted become more attractive or less attractive in a for-ex collapse.
