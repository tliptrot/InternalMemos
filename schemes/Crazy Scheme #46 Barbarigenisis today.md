Sketch - societies experience differential productive resources between regions. Broadly two comon strategies for acheiveing wealth are production and using violence to gain rents from other wealth producers. In the ancient world, the violence strategy often involved raiding/conquest to capture others rents. In modern societies, negotiation on violence capacity is a more popular strategy.

In both cases, groups choose to invest resources in either production or violence capacity. The returns to violence capacity depend on the resources of neighboring regions. For poorer neighbors of welathy regions investing all suprlus in violence may be the optimal strategy. In general, see the model here https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254240#sec012

One prediction of this model is that when rents are distributed by threat of violence, violence specialists should come mainly from poorer regions. For example, this occured in the roman empire as the legions increasingly recruited from the poorer provinces and the Roman core invested in production rather than violence.

The idea is to look for this pattern in modern authoritarian and democratic societies. So a poor region's share of violence specialists should be increasing in having rich neighbors. In democracies, we might not see this effect as violence produces less rents. T H E O R Y.
