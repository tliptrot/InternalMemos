# Are citizens affected by a policy better able to predict policy outcomes?

This should be quite easy to test. It's a classic "can you guess the RCT" result. Then we regress on Brier scores but include a survey variable for career or life experiences. So for education RCTs we add "are you a teacher, student or parent of a student" and stuff like that.

## Significance

If true, this is a huge mark in favor of proportional representation. Small parties can cater to people who care a lot about a single issue. If those high-carers are smarter policy predictors, then the small parties are smarter on those issues. So if the small party trades support for those issues we actually see more accurate policymaking overall.
