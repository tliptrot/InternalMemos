# Use NLP to understand "liberal" vs. "conservative" attitudes in LDC and compare to efects of liberalization or policy outputs

### Intuition

The intuition comes from Rudra and Tobin. The biggest problem is our lack of knowledge about the attitudes of elites in LDC's. We know about too few countries.

### Added value

Download newspapers and use their langauge to try and sense the liberal vs. conservative attitudes in question

Checks
- Can the same algorithm correctly code western newspapers into ideological camps?
- Do outputs agree with R&T's World Values Survey classification

### Alternative designs

Look for conservative/liberal ideology in Indian courts and compare outcomes and the states of India

### Information sources

Append survey to arab barometer surveys
  > less to defent reviewers are very conservative
