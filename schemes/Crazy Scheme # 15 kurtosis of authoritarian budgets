# Scheme 15, kurtosis of authoritarian budgets.


SO build a worldwide government budget dataset. Then use a simple AR classification scheme with dominant party, personalistic, military, whatever.

Then look for
1. Is the higher kurtosis of authoritarian regimes robust to the global dateset?
2. Are dominant party reigmes lower kurtosis than personalistic regimes. The argument is basically that SPR's have more information

Hey wht about Kurtosis and that principal component analysis for state capacity

Best,
Tim
