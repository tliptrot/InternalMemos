Based on this paper in Portugal - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecpo.12005?casa_token=QBwkINU8l5wAAAAA:n-VcBlVeVn6nK-lAd4xPgQhncf2309xdCZGim9rjTXEOnK9bJkctwhDKmlP14GlOFF1sbQdoSUIUtw

Take the lebanese municipalities
look at vote share for parties that defected from the government
assumption - there should be less funding given to municipalities that pass some threshold for defection from the government

Or we might expect greater divergence between the donations to that municipality from the state funding

# Data needs
- Vote share per municipality per party
- Disbursements to each municipality
- a list of the parties that defected toward the revolution
