## The Distribution of Politician Ability

Many formal theory papers involve assumptions about the ability distribution of politicians. They may assume ability is an exponential distribution, or a normal distribution or a lognormal distribution.

This is an important underlying attribute to check. Let us do so!

## Method!

Go to India. Recruit hundreds of politicians. Solicit, for incentives

1. A policy effect RCT prediction set, to create brier score
2. A future Indian political events (government change in province, vote share, major bills passing), create brier scores
3. Ask about more mundane outputs, time spent doiong various activity, text written on bills, and such things.

## Then study the results to identify the ability distribution of incumbents
