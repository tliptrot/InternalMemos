# Bayesian Regret of Preference Falsification Politics

Basic idea is to examine autocracy as a social choice function. We can use Shentrup style tools like Bayesian regret to compare it to democratic voting systems.

## Methods

Use this paper, or something similar https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.4895.pdf

## Innovation

In most voting models and social choice theory the cost of casting a vote is only the effect on the final policy chosen. But social choice outside of Democracies does not fit this pattern. In authoritarian states and weak democracies "voting" for a losing contender has personal consequences. Similarly for elites such as union bosses, journalists and prosecutors there are big rewards to betting on a winning horse.

This paper asks how much preference falsification damages the welfare produced by social choice. It uses a new measure of social choice function quality called Bayesian regret, which is found by simulating preferences and degrees of strategic behavior by voters.
