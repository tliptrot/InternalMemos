### Are policymakers in autocracies/non-mobilization regimes more independent of interest groups

Suppose that some policies exist which benefit no actors in the short term, but which some individuals passionately believe should occure. One example of this is foregoing profitable resource extraction in the short term in favor of future resource extraction.

Since some individuals see these issues as very important, if they become policymakers they might try to enact said policy. But if the policy lacks an interest group with short-term effective gains, it will be hard to implement. Interest groups are likely to stop it. But the degree to which interest groups matter to policy selection might vary between regimes. Democracies and certain authoritarian regimes rely heavily on mobilizing the people in support of policies. Maoist China is an authoritarian regime with this attribute. But in some regimes mobilizing the people in support of a policy is much less important. In some autocracies and semi-authoritarian states, policymakers rarely bring the people into the policymaking process, both to support and attack policies. Jordan and Burma have this attribute.

Issues with high variance-in-salience might receive more attention from these regimes. For example, this would explain the unpopular farm closures in Jordan. Are such policies actually more popular in these states?

### The example

Hazem El-Nasser in Jordan. Duh

### Operationalizations

How to test this, translate it into reality. Okay, take a bunch of policymaker surveys and look for issues that have the highest variance in salience, so some policymakers think its *really* important but some think it doesn't matter at all. See if those issues are more popular in low-mobilization states.

OR

Take long-termist policies. In theory these issues should be unpopu
