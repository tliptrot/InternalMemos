### One way to sell yourself on the phd market is to sell your data

Here are the theoretical contributions that you can sell:

1. There is something puzzling baout the world and I will explain it

2. There is somethign well understood ith a puzzling component that I will explain

3. These theories seem to be contradictory and I will explain how to navigate  that contradiction

All of those ways involve some form of data collection. One thing is that you have to evaluate where your poject is located. Are you addressing a dispute between camps, something studied alot, etc. For all of these projects you have to sort out the data about past theories. For example, you can take who said what and what are their arguments. Lay them out as a table. Arrange them, think about it. Therefore, data collection is ultimately inescapable.

Your question shold be "how can this type of data collection give me a leg up when I am presenting myself to the world as a scholar?". What kind of novel data can you create to spice up your project to sell it better. That is essentially what you are going to be doing 5 years from now.

I collected 2,000 [thingies] in Romania to create a village level measure of corruption. I have done it. Of course the theory component is more important. But the data collection is a very high return strategy that you can sell yourself with it. I felt that I needed to push to a different level to ask different questions than people have asked in the past. 

Lots of off-the-shelf data is overused, like correlates of war. The problem is greatest in IR. The marginal return to off-the-shelf data gets lower and lower. If you are going that route you should base your appeal on new theory.

### 2nd point - Quant/Qual divide is artificial

The qual and quant divide is useful but it is also artificial. Those who collect quant will also be collecting lots of qualitative data as well. The fieldwork did not just involve collecing quant, lots of qual along the way. [This is the starting point of KKV's seminal work]

In practice you have to get through a bunch of gatekeepers who will sit on the way[, like bureaucrats or party PR staff]. You will need qualitative data to learn how to get past these [trolls].

And you will need lots of qual to design your regression discontinuity [or other analysis method]

### 3rd point - Make a pre-analysis plan

Pre-analysis plan is becoming popular. Partly it is for stopping p-hacking. But it also forces you to have foresight and to think ahead before you move forward.

# Q&A

Rashaud - how do you amanage multiple collaborators with differences of opinion

MK - have a clear division of labor. Who is doing what part of data collection?

Keep the qualitativists separate from the quantitativists.

DK - coming up with a good organization system actually takes some real introspection. [What type of system works for me? How do I navigate tasks?]

Tim - what are the failure modes of collaborations

MK - My failure modes that didn't work out most frequently were mostly with other students. They were all started in grad school or shortly after graduate school/ these are the likelies to fail. I've learned a great deal from coauthoring with more senior people. In terms of incentives it's not ideal [it gives the impression that you are not an independent thinker to hiring committees].

DK - Failure to be flexible. You have to give some, they have to give some. You cannot win every battle. Let that horrific sentence or organization go. Be more agreeable. There will be things your coauthors write that you have to let go. Have flexibility.

MR - when I have been a bad partner is often when I have taken on too mcuh. There is always a lot to do, but sometimes its too much. The secret to success "underpromise and overdeliver". Do not do the oppossite, remember to say no.

MK - Remember which project is which? There is a natural tendency to have one project spill over into another one. But you want to keep them apart as much as possible. You do not want to cross ideas between collaborations. This can be hard
