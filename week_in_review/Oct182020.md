##### Review of events

BUsy schoolday. Slightly boring class with Girod on methods, despite the fascinating readings. Other students not as jazzed about it I guess.

Also Girod was rather critical of the scheme on ideology and outcomes. She criticized the underlying intuition. Honestly I think she was wrong, but I didn't say that. I am uncertain how agreeable I shold be in theose interactions.
