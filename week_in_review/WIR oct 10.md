##### Habits under construction

The last two months I have lost most of my ADHD management habits. This is a tragic fact, but it is obviously true. I know need to rebuild them from the ground up.

The best way to do that is one or two habits at a time. That measn I must start with task list returning. This is a good time to reinvision the task list.
Because I am rebuilding the habit now, today I can look openly at the flaws of the current system. The greatest flaw is that I often lose or forget about my master task list. I can fix this by ripping the task list out of my notebook every week and pasting it to the shelf beside my desk. Then every morning I can look at it and my calendar and write the tasks into my notebook. NOTE - then my moleskin must always be in the same place.

Okay then, new plan. I have moved my id and cc's to my moleskin. That way I will always have it. Every day will have a spread, maybe two from the moleskin. The moleskin must be made from the task list every morning. Then all will be well. 

Then from the task list I will have breakdowns only for desk-tasks in the  green notebook, which will go sequentially by day.
